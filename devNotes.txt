V's notes, ideas, and observations:

Have subtopics and resource finder be constructed during time needed

make a factory or something to help with constructing buttons for resource finder

make a singleton to manage which page to display and when
 - hashtable? have each page have a distinct number for it?

use a stack to make back button functionality

class for each category + options

instead of multiple JFrames, hb multiple JPanels with JFrames?
